# Dear future me.
You can be proud of yourself that you have a very own backend and website. But please I BEG YOU

## WRITE THE DAMN TESTS

Not only you work with multi-directory project structure, but you test everything by **running website and look at endpoints!!**

### THIS CAN NOT CONTINUE

Please, dear future me. Have mercy to write better and modular code that *can be* tested by **UNIT-test** and **FUZZING-test**

At least do this for

- SQL-related stuff
- Any IO operations (in future)
- Any calculations/conversations/user-services

### THANK YOU!!
